# Basic Data Structures

[Assignments](assignments.md) • [Schedule](schedule.md) • [Lectures](lectures.md) • [Staff](staff.md)

## Overview
Welcome! This course aims to provide a broad overview into the basic data structures
that are a crucial part to the development of computer science fundamentals. We will
explore implementation details in both Java and C++, as well as discuss features and
techniques in both languages. The goal is to develop a sense of "language agnosticism" in regards
to both fundamental programming techniques as well as the specifics of data structures/ADTs to build
a solid base on which new skills can be formed.

## Grading Breakdown

**Programming Assignments (35%)**: There will be 8 programming assignments of varying length and difficulty.
Turnin instructions will be posted with the assignments. Do note that you have a _total_ of **4 late days**
that can be used as needed throughout the quarter, with one late day defined as turning in the assignment anywhere from
1 second to 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds past the deadline.

**Exams (65%)**: There are two midterms (one week 5 and the other week 8) and a final exam. For both midterms, a one-sided
study sheet is allowed, with the final allowing for a two-sided sheet. This percentage will be calculated in one of three ways,
whichever is highest:
1. midterm 1 (15%) + midterm 2 (15%) + final (35%)
2. drop one midterm + midterm (30%) + final (35%)
3. drop one midterm + midterm (15%) + final (50%)

**Piazza (5%)**: Extra credit awarded to top-20 best contributers, as determined by the team.
