# Nate's CSE 12 Redesign
## A New Approach to a Basic Data Structures Course

### Introduction
I'm not a professor, but if I ever was teaching a Basic Data Structures course,
this would be it. It's designed as an alternative to [UCSD's current CSE
12](https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/CSE.html#cse12).

Since it is designed with UCSD in mind, it is written to work in a 10 week
quarter system. It could pretty easily be adapted to work in a semester based
system though; just space stuff out more.

All are able to modify this and adapt it as you see fit (open source FTW), just
give me credit please and thanks.
